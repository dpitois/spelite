# Spelite User Guide

Welcome to Spelite, your streamlined D&D 5e spell management companion. This guide will help you get started with creating your character and managing your spellbook.

## Getting Started

When you first open the application, you will be directed to the **Setup** view to create your first character.

## 1. Character Management

In the **Setup** tab, you have two main sections: **Edit** and **Manage**.

### Creating a Character

1. Go to the **Manage** tab.
2. Click on **Create New Character**. This will create a blank character sheet and set it as active.
3. You can also **Import** characters from a JSON file if you have a backup or a character shared by a friend.

### Switching and Deleting

- All your characters are stored locally in your browser.
- Use the **Load** button next to a character's name in the **Manage** tab to switch to them.
- Use the **Delete** button to remove a character. _Warning: This action is permanent unless you have an export._

## 2. Character Setup (Editing)

Once you have a character selected, switch to the **Edit** tab to fill in their details.

### Basic Information

- **Name**: Enter your character's name.
- **Class & Subclass**: Select your class. Some classes (like Clerics or Paladins) have specific spell preparation rules that Spelite handles automatically.
- **Race**: Enter your character's race.
- **Level**: Set your character's level. This automatically determines your proficiency bonus and available spell slots.

### Ability Scores

The **Ability Scores** section allows you to enter your Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores.

- These scores are used to calculate your spell save DC and spell attack bonus (based on your class's primary ability).
- The modifiers are calculated automatically.

### Combat Stats

- **Max HP**: Enter your maximum hit points.
- **Base AC**: Enter your base Armor Class (before modifiers).

**Important**: Don't forget to click the **Save Character** button at the bottom to apply your changes!
